# etch-a-sketch

**Project details**
I am creating something similar to an etch-a-sketch which allows you to draw neat little pixel art.

**Tasks**
- [X] Create a grid with 16x16 divs, the divs can only be created via JS
- [X] Hovering over the grid-box changes the color of div and has a drawing effect 
- [X] Give the User a way to change the grid size. Maximum is 100x100

**Polish the code and the UX**
- [X] Remade the canvas with grid
- [X] Resize Function needs polishing

**Extra Task**
- [X] Add rainbow pen
- [X] Add a reset button
- [X] Give it a nice design
